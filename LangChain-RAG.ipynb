       "'The sky appears blue because of a process called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the molecules of air and other gases in the atmosphere. Sunlight is composed of different colors of light, which have different wavelengths and frequencies. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters more air molecules and smaller particles than when it reaches outer space. These molecules and particles scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter it more efficiently at shorter wavelengths, such as blue and violet. This means that these colors are scattered more widely across the sky, making it appear blue to our eyes. However, sunlight also contains red and orange light, which have longer wavelengths and are scattered less by the atmosphere. These colors reach us from the horizon or from objects that reflect sunlight, such as the moon or clouds, making them appear reddish or orange. This is why the sky looks different at sunrise and sunset, when the sun is lower in the sky and the light has to travel through more air and dust.'"
